## ⚠️ Important Submission Guidelines for Students

To ensure proper tracking and credit, **every student must adhere to the following rule** in all C++ programs submitted:

In the `main` function of every program, the **very first line of executable code** must print your name and roll number, followed by a newline.

### Example Code Requirement:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // ⬇️ THIS LINE IS MANDATORY
    std::cout << "YOUR NAME  YOUR ROLL NO." << std::endl; 
    
    // ... rest of the program logic follows
    // Example:
    std::cout << "Hello World!";

    return 0;
}
